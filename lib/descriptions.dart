const String appOmniJobDescription = """
In my role as a backend engineer at AppOmni, I contributed to the development and extension of a data access model platform, which at a high level is used to describe all access among users to any asset in our customer's SaaS app. To accomplish this, we used Python 3, the Django framework, PostgreSQL for relational storage, MongoDB for engine functionality, and the GCP suite for deployments and monitoring. We worked with many SaaS applications such as Salesforce, Microsoft Office, and Workday, which all involved the collection of large amounts of data and making assessments on that data. These efforts provided clients with a comprehensive view of their assets and access, and I was recognized for my contributions to the team's success.

At GoGuardian, I developed and maintained a mobile app using Flutter and Golang that filters student network traffic and enables monitoring of student behavior, motivation, and learning. I also worked to debug and resolve issues with legacy SaaS applications written in Golang to ensure software stability and reliability. We worked in an efficient agile environment to deliver high-quality code on time. I spent a lot of time directly with QA and the Customer Implementation Specialists to design a product that delivered on its promises and was as easy to deploy to a school district as possible.

const String yaptaJobDescription = """
As a software developer at Yapta, later to be acquired by Coupa, I played a key role in developing and maintaining multiple microservices and monolithic applications written in Java and Python. I worked my way up the ladder, starting at showing my small team what I could do one story at a time, and eventually led a team in splitting a larger rebooking service into microservices to enable faster deployments and sharing of entire workflows among other teams. I was renowned for stellar code reviews to ensure high code quality standards were met, as I was one of the larger code owners in the company. I leveraged Agile SDLC methodologies to manage daily sprints, prioritize tasks, and track progress towards project goals. Additionally, I aided in the migration of legacy code to new versions and deployment strategies, improving efficiency and reducing technical debt. Finally, I demonstrated expertise in quickly identifying, debugging, and resolving issues with a legacy system that was core to all products.
